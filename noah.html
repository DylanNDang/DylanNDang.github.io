			<h1 style="text-align:center">Hello my name is Noah and this is my section of the website</h1>
			<p style="text-align:center">I have a tiny bit of experience with Java but no experience making websites other than occasionally making a site on Wix or similar</p>
			<p style="text-align:center">Im currently hoping to get into my CS major, but if I don't I have <strong>NO IDEA</strong> what I am gonna do</p>
			<div></div>
			<h2 style="text-align:center" >My interests</h2>
			<p style="color:blueviolet"> I have a <strong>LOT</strong> of interests although <span style=color:crimson>the <strong>PANDEMIC</strong></span> has killed a lot of the activities I would normally do</p>
			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Here is a table of my interests and how often I get to practice them during the pandemic</h2>
			
			<table style ="background-color:cyan style"= width = 75%; border="2"; width="1000">

					<td width="50%"><strong>Hobby</strong></td>
					<td width="50%"> <strong>How often</strong></td>

				<td width="50%"><strong>Basketball</strong></td>
				<td width="50%"> once or twice a week</td>

		<p style="text-align:center">I saw that Ethan did a sports favorites list, I am going to do the same but with my opinion on the sports</p>

				<td width="50%"><strong>Sport</strong></td>
				<td width="50%"> <strong>Opinion/Reasoning</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><strong>Basketball</strong></td>
				<td width="50%"> Im very tall and it comes easy, can't shoot at all though 9/10 would recommend</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><strong>Baseball</Strong></td>
				<td width="50%">Favorite sport since I was born, hitting is fun, fielding gets boring if not in infield 10/10 would recommend</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><strong>Football</Strong></td>
				<td width="50%">Great sport played for many years but injuries in that sport are too common and basketball brings me much more fun. 6/10 fun to watch but playing can be tedious</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><strong>Soccer</strong></td>
				<td width="50%">Other than golf I think I hate this sport the most, its probably because I can only use my feet and I had never got the coordination down, goalie was the only position I could play effectively. Its a little fun to watch tho 3/10 :(</td>
