			<h1 style=text-align:center>Hello my name is Noah and this is my section of the website</h1>
			<p style=text-align:center>I have a tiny bit of experience with Java but no experience making websites other than occasionally making a site on Wix or similar</p>
			<p style=text-align:center>Im currently hoping to get into my CS major, but if I don't I have <strong>NO IDEA</strong> what I am gonna do</p>
			<div></div>
			<h2 style=text-align:center >My interests</h2>
			<p style=color:blueviolet> I have a <strong>LOT</strong> of interests although <span style=color:crimson>the <strong>PANDEMIC</strong></span> has killed a lot of the activities I would normally do</p>
			<h2 style="text-align: center;">Here is a table of my interests and how often I get to practice them during the pandemic</h2>
			<table style =background-color:cyan style="width: 75%;" border="2" width="1000">

				<td width="50%"> <strong>Opinion/Reasoning</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><strong>Basketball</strong></td>
				<td width="50%"> Im very tall and it comes easy, can't shoot at all though 9/10 would recommend</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><Strong>Baseball</Strong></td>
				<td width="50%">Favorite sport since I was born, hitting is fun, fielding gets boring if not in infield 10/10 would reccomend</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><Strong>Football</Strong></td>
				<td width="50%">Great sport played for many years but injuries in that sport are too common and basketball brings me much more fun. 6/10 fun to watch but playing can be tedious</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td width="50%"><Strong>Soccer</Strong></td>
				<td width="50%">Other than golf I think I hate this sport the most, its probably because I can only use my feet and I had never got the coordination down, goalie was the only position I could play efffectively. Its a little fun to watch tho 3/10 :(</td>
